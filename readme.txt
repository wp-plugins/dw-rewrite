Creates a new rewrite rule that will allow users to login, access WP dashboard, Register and access the forgot password page using using "pretty" urls instead of the regular, ugly, default WordPress URLs. This plugin takes advantage of the WordPress Rewrite API.

== Description ==

This plugin creates 4 rewrite rules that will allow users to login, register, access the forgot password form and the admin dashboard using pretty URLs. An example of this would be "/admin" to access "/wp-amdin/" and "/login" for "/wp-login.php". This is what is called a "pretty" URL.

The original links will still work but it just looks a bit better is passing out links.
