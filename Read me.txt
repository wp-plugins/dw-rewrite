== Description ==

Creates a new rewerite rule that will allow users to login from "yourdomain.com/login" instead of the WordPress default login URL "yourdomain.com/wp-login.php" and also allow them to access the WordPress Dashboard from "/admin" instead of "/wp-admin/".  This plugin takes advantage of the WordPress Rerite API.
"/wp-login.php" & "/wp-admin/" will still work but the rewritten URl will look better if your linking to the new URL and giving it our to people. :)
